# Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres

#### Course Learning Outcomes:
* Understand when to use a relational database
* Understand the difference between OLAP and OLTP databases
* Create normalized data tables
* Implement denormalized schemas (e.g. STAR, Snowflake)

#### Project Description: Data Modeling with Postgres
* Model user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app called Sparkify.
* Define Fact and Dimension tables for a STAR schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.  
* Insert data into new tables.

Sparkify's Analytics team will be able to query the newly designed relational database with ease to understand user behaviors such as what songs users are listening to.
